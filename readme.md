This is the the repository of mesh on demand recreation using LSTM model. MeSH on Demand returns a list of MeSH Terms relevant to your text. Use it to discover MeSH terms for an author’s manuscript to find similar papers, or load abstracts from citations that are “Pubmed – In Process” or “Pubmed – As supplied by publisher” to get a feel for MeSH that may be assigned.
